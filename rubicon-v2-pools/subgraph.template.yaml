Entity: CToken
event Mint(address minter, uint mintAmount, uint mintTokens); - mintAmount is the amount of the underlying being deposited & mintTokens is the amount of the cToken being minted
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint amount); - this should be used to track all cToken transfers, however we may just handle this at the mint/redeem level because we are having to utilize that to track the underlying balances

event AccrueInterest(uint cashPrior, uint interestAccumulated, uint borrowIndex, uint totalBorrows); - totalBorrows is incremented here with the updated interest that has been accrued 
    - totalReservesNew = interestAccumulated * reserveFactor + totalReserves
    // one thing i am unclear about here is why the events ReservesAdded & ReservesReduced are not utilized here?
event NewReserveFactor(uint oldReserveFactorMantissa, uint newReserveFactorMantissa);

event ReservesAdded(address benefactor, uint addAmount, uint newTotalReserves);
event ReservesReduced(address admin, uint reduceAmount, uint newTotalReserves);






// when does totalReserves get updated?
- any time accrueInterest() is called 
- any time seizeInternal() is called
- any time _addReservesFresh() is called
- any time _reduceReservesFresh() is called
